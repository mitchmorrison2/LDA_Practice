I am looking into ML models and decided to follow a guide from a Medium article by Susan Li at https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-and-latent-dirichlet-allocation-in-python-9bf156893c24

This is both my first Juptyer project and ML model, so both are a quick dry run. The data set used for this project is from Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines
